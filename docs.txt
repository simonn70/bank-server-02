this app is for withdrawing and depositing money into a bank account
the two user involved are the bank and the bank member
THE USER EXPERIENCE
when a user logs in, he would log in with his account number and a password
if the credentials are valid, he is then logged into to the system
once logged in, he has access to all the accounts that he has with that bank
he may chose to withdraw cash or deposit cash
if he decides to deposit cash, the Paystack api is used as a third party library to facilitate the transaction
a record of the transaction is kept in our database for future reference purposes
if he decides to withdraw cash, he is to select which of the accounts he is withdrawing from and provide the amount he's going to withdraw
a request is then sent to the admin side which is the bank interface which would then be approved or rejected
this transaction is also recorded in the database for future reference purposes
a record of all transactions is kept for the user so he can get access to them at anytime
THE ADMIN EXPERIENCE
the admin panel would belong to the banks and they would have login details for that
when the bank logs in, they can see a dashboard which would contain their members and their active members
it would also show the financial transactions, their numbers and other details
there would be the option to add new users whether individually or in bulk
there would also be the option to list all the members of the bank
the admin, which is the bank, would be able to update member details too
the admin can also reject or approve pending withdrawals which are made by the user
the admin also has access to all the records of the transactions that go on in the bank
